# Overview
I completed these labs when I took the 'APS360 - Introduction to Machine Learning' course offered at UofT St. George. My professor was Sinisa Colic. In this folder, you'll find some of the many labs I have completed. The skills I have learned include but are not limited to: cleansing and normalizing the data, utilizing Sklearn to build classifier and regression models for csv data, and building and optimizing ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Autoencoders using PyTorch. Through this experience, I developed a deeper understanding of the neural network structure, methods of optimizing the model, and methods of reducing overfit/underfit.
