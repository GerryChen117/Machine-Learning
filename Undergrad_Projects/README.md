# Overview
In this folder, you'll find some of the many labs I completed when I took the 'APS360 - Introduction to Machine Learning' course offered at UofT St. George under the guidance of my professor, Sinisa Colic. 

Through this experience, I've learned methods of cleansing and normalizing data, reducing overfit/underfit, and optimizing a machine learning model. In these labs, I've utilized Sklearn to build and optimize classifier and regression models for csv data, and I've employed PyTorch to build and optimize ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Autoencoders.
